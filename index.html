        Ochini Awu: The Face Behind the Blog

    <h2>
        her humble beginnings
    </h2>

    <p> 
        Lush greenery nor an aquatic view greeted Ochini when she looked out of her windows as a young girl. Stoop after stoop and several windows created the scene that stared back at her - The true definition of a concrete jungle. Onchini grew up in New York City, New York, in the neighborhood known as Harlem, on October 21, 1997. Although grateful for the rich culture Harlem bore, she always had an affinity for nature and was able to relish in the natural beauty of Cross River State, Nigeria, where her parents are from.

        her pain
    </h2>

    <p>
        As a young woman in today's society, Ochini was often teased in elementary school based on her complexion as well as her ethnic name. It wasn't until she attended high school that she was able to realize the deeply rooted issue of colorism within the black community that surrounded her. She often felt overlooked by young men due to her skintone. Media didn't make things any better with its lack of representation of dark skinned women. Ochini stated that dark skinned female entertainers were "like unicorns."

        her solution
    </h2>

    <p>
        With negatively affected self esteem, Ochini decided to address her destitution of self love by making a committed effort to learn to love and value herself just as she was. She began with lengthy "mirror sessions," as she'd call them, where she stood or sat in front of a mirror and thoroughly analyzed her physical traits. She'd then tell herself that she loved and appreciated that specific trait because it's what GOD gave her followed by the recital of Psalm 139:13 - 14:

        13For you created my inmost being;
        you knit me together in my motherâ€™s womb.
            
        14I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
        your works are wonderful,
        I know that full well.
            
        She began to study fashion and color theory to find out how to dress and enhance her natural beauty. Ochini also began to carefully choose what she'd listen to and watch. Ochini states that she is aware that media is a powerful tool and believes that being conscientious of what one takes in is important for that person's spirit and state of mind. She also tried to find support online for dark skinned women who needed to learn to elevate themselves, but she found that task difficult as she realized there weren't many online spaces for that demographic. Determined to build herself up, as well as others like her, she decided to create one herself...
